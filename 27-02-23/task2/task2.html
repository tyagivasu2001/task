    <p>
        The grouping selector select all the HTML elemnts with the same defination ,
        like there are 3 elemnts p,h1,h2 and i perform same task on them but i define them 
        sepertaly so to be better to write them together and separte them with coma, this will reduce the code size

    <h3>Ways to build life style better</h3>
    <p>
        The ideal lifestyle is possible. Everyone can live the way they want… and in fact, they do. Because the way you live now,
         regardless of whether you like it or not, is what you chose to live like.

        And you realize that mostly when you compare yourself to others, or when you do things you don’t want to do 
        (the job you don’t like, different tasks and commitments). It’s when you see the bigger picture and understand this 
        is not the way you want to live that you become aware of the fact that you can actually live better. So then you ask
         yourself: “What do I want my life to be like?” and “Who do I want to be in it?”.
        
        And that itself is the first step towards your journey to the ideal life. It’s not about perfectionism, not at all.
         It’s about not having to work something we can’t stand, do things we don’t want, miss opportunities, lack time and 
         sleep and so on.
        
        It’s about enjoying life more, doing what you love, becoming someone you can be proud of, doing things for others 
        and actually spending more time with your loved ones, creating things, giving and sharing… and simply being happy 
        and contented with every day of your life.

    <h3>Books</h3>
    <p>
        Start with what you envision for your book first, rather than what you think is least expensive. You can always 
        choose more cost-effective options later, and you might be surprised by what’s most affordable. Just because local 
        copy shops use plastic spiral bindings doesn’t mean that spiral bindings are the cheapest option in offset printing—in 
        fact, the opposite is true.

When choosing your book specs, you should always consider the budget of your readers and what’s best for your publication. 
Keep your book’s aesthetic within the expectations of your genre, which means researching comparable titles.

While printing signatures are important when it comes to the actual printing of your book, don’t obsess over your final page 
count. While it’s best to keep your page count at a multiple of eight, which is an industry standard, you should write and 
format your book without this in mind until the very end. You can always add a few pages of content if need be (e.g., a page to 
thank your Kickstarter backers), or we will add blank pages to complete printing signatures if your file isn’t divisible by eight.
