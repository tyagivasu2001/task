    <div><h1>India</h1>
        India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. Its capital is New Delhi, built in the 20th century just 
        south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to serve as India’s administrative centre. Its government is a constitutional
         republic that represents a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of ethnic groups and likely hundreds of 
         languages. With roughly one-sixth of the world’s total population, India is the second most populous country, after 
         China.

        It is known from archaeological evidence that a highly sophisticated urbanized culture—the Indus civilization—dominated 
        the northwestern part of the subcontinent from about 2600 to 2000 BCE. From that period on, India functioned as a virtually
         self-contained political and cultural arena, which gave rise to a distinctive tradition that was associated primarily with
          Hinduism, the roots of which can largely be traced to the Indus civilization. Other religions, notably Buddhism and 
          Jainism, originated in India—though their presence there is now quite small—and throughout the centuries residents of 
          the subcontinent developed a rich intellectual life in such fields as mathematics, astronomy, architecture, literature,
           music, and the fine arts.

        Throughout its history, India was intermittently disturbed by incursions from beyond its northern mountain wall. 
        Especially important was the coming of Islam, brought from the northwest by Arab, Turkish, Persian, and other raiders
         beginning early in the 8th century CE. Eventually, some of those raiders stayed; by the 13th century much of the 
         subcontinent was under Muslim rule, and the number of Muslims steadily increased. Only after the arrival of the 
         Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498 and the subsequent establishment of European maritime supremacy in the 
         region did India become exposed to major external influences arriving by sea, a process that culminated in the 
         decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent within the British Empire.</div>
