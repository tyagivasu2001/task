     <h1>Wars between India and Pakistan </h1>
     <h3>Indo-pakistan war 1947</h3>
     <p>
    The war, also called the First Kashmir War, started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that the Maharaja of the princely 
    of Kashmir and Jammu would accede to India. Following partition, princely states were left to choose whether to join India or
     Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population 
     and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh. Tribal Islamic forces with support
    from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharaja to sign the Instrument of 
     Accession of the princely state to the Dominion of India to receive Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passed 
    Resolution 47 on 22 April 1948. The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as the Line of Control. A formal 
    cease-fire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 1 January 1949.[9]: 379  India gained control of about two-thirds of the 
     state (Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh) whereas Pakistan gained roughly a third of Kashmir (Azad Kashmir, and 
     Gilgit-Baltistan). The Pakistan controlled areas are collectively referred to as Pakistan administered Kashmir
     </p>
     <h3>Indo-Pakistani War of 1965</h3>
     <p>This war started following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir 
        to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West 
        Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of 
        armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II.[14][15] The hostilities between the two countries ended 
        after a ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and USA and the subsequent issuance 
        of the Tashkent Declaration.[16] India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared</p>
        <h3>Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</h3>
        <p>This war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather precipitated by the crisis 
            created by the political battle brewing in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 
            Leader of East Pakistan, and Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, leaders of West Pakistan. This would culminate in 
            the declaration of Independence of Bangladesh from the state system of Pakistan. Following Operation Searchlight and 
            the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in neighbouring India.[22] 
            India intervened in the ongoing Bangladesh liberation movement.[23][24] After a large scale pre-emptive strike by 
            Pakistan, full-scale hostilities between the two countries commenced.</p>
            <h3>
                Indo-Pakistani War of 1999
            </h3>
            <p>
                Commonly known as the Kargil War, this conflict between the two countries was mostly limited. During early 1999,
                 Pakistani troops infiltrated across the Line of Control (LoC) and occupied Indian territory mostly in the Kargil
                  district. India responded by launching a major military and diplomatic offensive to drive out the Pakistani
                   infiltrators.[31] Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were 
                   encroached by the infiltrators.[32][33] According to official count, an estimated 75%–80% of the intruded area
                    and nearly all high ground was back under Indian control.[34] Fearing large-scale escalation in military
                     conflict, the international community, led by the United States, increased diplomatic pressure on Pakistan 
                     to withdraw forces from remaining Indian territory.[31][35] Faced with the possibility of international 
                     isolation, the already fragile Pakistani economy was weakened further.[36][37] The morale of Pakistani 
                     forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of the Northern Light Infantry suffered heavy casualties.
                     [38][39] The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers,[40][41] an issue that provoked 
                     outrage and protests in the Northern Areas.[42][43] Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its 
                     casualties, but Nawaz Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation
                      and that Pakistan had lost the conflict.[44][45] By the end of July 1999, organized hostilities in the 
                      Kargil district had ceased.[35] The war was a major military defeat for the Pakistani Army.
