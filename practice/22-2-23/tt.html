            engineering, Professional art of applying science to the optimum conversion of the resources of 
            nature to the uses of humankind. Engineering is based principally on physics, chemistry, and mathematics 
            and their extensions into materials science, solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, transfer and rate
            processes, and systems analysis. A great body of special knowledge is associated with engineering;
            preparation for professional practice involves extensive training in the application of that knowledge.
            Engineers employ two types of natural resources, materials and energy. Materials acquire uses that 
            reflect their properties: their strength, ease of fabrication, lightness, or durability; their ability 
            to insulate or conduct; and their chemical, electrical, or acoustical properties. Important sources of 
            energy include fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, gas), wind, sunlight, falling water, and nuclear fission.
            See also aerospace engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering. genetic engineering, mechanical
            engineering, military engineering.
